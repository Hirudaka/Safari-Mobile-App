## About Project

Sri Lanka offers incredible safari experiences, but several challenges can affect the enjoyment and safety of these adventures. 

Key issues include travelers' lack of wildlife knowledge, drivers exceeding speed limits and causing traffic jams, confusion about route coverage, and insufficient emergency communication due to poor cell phone coverage. 

Our innovative solution leverages AI/ML, image processing, and location tracking to address these problems, enhancing educational experiences, providing offline emergency features, improving safety, and offering a more immersive exploration of Sri Lanka's naturalÂ wonders.
